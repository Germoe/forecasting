# Introduction

This is a repository of all my kaggle projects related to forecasting.

The data is available on kaggle and should be downloaded from there and stored in the data folder in the root directory of the project (e.g. `data/{project_name}`). Each jupyter notebook has a link to the kaggle dataset.
